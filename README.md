# Engineering Fundamentals 01 - Git

This repository is intended for Git Training only. Code or text provided inside might not be suitable or correctly written. The content ins't the purpose of this repository, but rather the repository itself.

## Pre-requisites

1. Make sure you have Git command line tools installed. There are multiple ways of doing it and as long as the result is that you can execute Git-commands from a terminal window, then you have succeeded. The official documentation and downloads can be found at https://git-scm.com/

2. Make sure you have a valid account at https://github.com . If not, then sign up for one.

3. Visual Studio Code isn't technically required but is a great editor for most things so please have it installed. https://code.visualstudio.com/ 

## The assignment

You are asked to contribute to the OpenSource project [Engineering Fundamentals 01 - Git](https://github.com/krist00fer/ef-01-git), i.e. this project. Follow the proposed OpenSource contribution workflow to add a new file/script/program into the folder: `src/greetings`

The file should be named: hello-name.ext

Where "name" should be replaced with your name and ext should be replaced with an extension that suits the programming language used.

> For example, my name is Kristofer and I'm using Python as my programming language, therfor the file should be named and created as following: `/src/greetings/hello-kristofer.py`

If there already exists a file with that name, please implement a unique name.

If executed, the file/script/program should output a greeting similar to this:

```
$ python hello-kristofer.py
Hello Kristofer
```

## Limitations

* All Git-commands should be executed using a terminal window. No Git-utilities (including Visual Studio Code) are allowed to use for executing Git-instructions, unless deemed as the last resort. Executing commands from the terminal window will enhance your ability to understand what's happening.


## Definition of done

You are considered done, once your script is successfully incorporated into this repository.

## Additional instructions

There are three set of instructions. Challenge yourself on the right level:

### Challenge Level Hard

This is it! There are no more instructions. Off you go!

### Challenge Level Medium

These instructions will give you a checklist of what you need to do, but you'll have to execute the commands yourself. [See the instructions here](docs/instructions-medium.md).

### Challenge Level Easy

Instructions will guide you through all the steps you need to do to fullfill the assignment. [See the instructions here](docs/instructions-easy.md).
